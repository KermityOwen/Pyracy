# Pyracy
> Haha, get it? Piracy...? Python...? Pyracy...? Nevermind forget it

### How it works:
- Run the Main.py file
- Type in your search term
- That's it! Check your download folder and it's there.

### Progress Goals:
- Make it easier to use by having a compiled executable to install
- Implement a GUI or attach it to a site
- Turn the entire project "dependency-less" by studying the imported libraries 
and how they work (Specifically Pytube and Requests)
