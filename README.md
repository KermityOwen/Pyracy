### What is Pyracy:
This is a small project I've been working on to make downloading
YouTube videos slightly easier. Typically, you would have to use an
online downloader after manually searching for the URLs. With 
Pyracy you can search for videos on YouTube locally and download
it without ever opening your browser.

### How to download
- Press the big green button that says "Code"
- Download ZIP file
- Extract and Voila! Easy and done!

---

### How it works:
- Edit the config.json file to set your download path
- Run the Pyracy.exe executable.
- Type in your search term.
- Then type in your choice number.
- That's it! Check your download folder and it's there.

### Progress Goals:
- :white_check_mark: Make it easier to use by having a compiled executable to install
- Turn the entire project "dependency-less" by studying the imported libraries 
and how they work (Specifically Pytube and Requests)
- Implement a GUI or attach it to a site
